                <h2>To my dearest, Sol 💖</h2>

                <p>
                    Wifeyy, first of all, I’m so happy that I met you. The moment I heard your voice
                    when we played Mobile Legends for the first time, I already liked you.
                    It’s your voice that made me feel happy that time. Your voice is like a
                    music to my ears—it gives peace. The fireflies at night dance as soon as
                    they hear that sweet voice of yours.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Wifey, you know how much I love you. I love everything about you—your voice,
                    your eyes, your nose, your hair, especially the bangs. You know I always
                    make fun of it kasi it’s not pantay in the morning when you wake up.
                </p>

                <p>
                    I also love your personality. I fell in love with it, and you surprised me
                    with seven more—but I still love them all.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Wifey, thank you for choosing me as your Valentine and your partner for life.
                    I wish you all the happiness this world could offer. You deserve all the love
                    and happiness in this world.
                </p>

                <p>
                    I will stay with you and make you happy, even though sometimes I ubos your
                    patience and I made you upset many times in a week.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Always remember that I love you so, so much. I’m yours and you’re mine only.
                    Sounds obsessive—but yeah. You make me love myself more, and I hope you love
                    yourself just the same.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Let’s stay in lovee and grow together despite all the misunderstandings.
                </p>

                <p>
                    I look forward to having a future with you.
                </p>

                <p>
                    I love you so much, my pretty and cutiee wifeyy.
